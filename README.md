# Wazuh

To use this script effectively, you would follow these steps, tailored to a Unix-like environment with Bash shell. This script is designed for setting up and deploying a SIEM stack using Docker and Wazuh for security monitoring. Here's how you can proceed:

Pre-requisites
Before running the script, ensure you have:

A Unix-like operating system (Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian are suitable).
Root or sudo privileges to install packages and perform system configurations.
Bash shell available (default in most Linux distributions).
Internet connection to download necessary packages and clone repositories.
Steps to Use the Script
Save the Script: Copy the script you provided into a file named install.sh on your system. You can do this by opening a text editor, pasting the script, and saving the file.

Make the Script Executable:

Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory containing install.sh.
Run the command to make it executable:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x install.sh
Run the Script:

Still in the terminal, execute the script with either ./install.sh or bash install.sh.
The script will request sudo privileges as needed, so you may be prompted to enter your password.
Follow On-screen Prompts:

Enter a new password: When prompted, enter a password that will be used within the SIEM stack. This is important for securing your deployment.
Generate and Enter the Password Hash: After entering the password, you'll be instructed to run a command to generate a hash of this password. Follow the instructions, then input the resulting hash when prompted.
Monitor the Installation Process:

The script provides feedback on its progress and will log errors to install.log. If any step fails, it will stop execution due to the set -e flag at the beginning of the script.
You can monitor the install.log file to understand what the script is doing or if there are any errors you need to address.
Completion:

Once the script finishes successfully, your SIEM stack deployment will be complete. The script will output "SIEM stack deployment completed." indicating everything went as expected.
After Installation
Verify the Deployment: Check that all Docker containers are up and running by executing sudo docker ps.
Access the SIEM Dashboard: Follow the Wazuh or your specific SIEM dashboard documentation to access the web interface and start monitoring your environment.
Check install.log: Review the install.log file for any recorded inputs or errors during the installation process.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

Check the install.log file for error messages.
Ensure all pre-requisites are met and that your user has sudo privileges.
Verify your internet connection and access to the URLs the script attempts to download from.
Important Notes
Security: Be mindful of the security implications of the passwords and hashes you use. Ensure they are strong and stored securely.
Customization: You might need to modify the script to fit your specific environment or if you're using different versions of the software it installs.
By following these steps, you should be able to use the script to automate the deployment of a SIEM stack, enhancing your system's security monitoring capabilities.
